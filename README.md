# Chemistry Calculator
## Pitch
To quote Giselle from the movie *Enchanted*, everybody wants to know their true love is true! Considering that the Internet can retrieve just about any piece of information at the click of a button, why not give it a try at your love life?

## Key Features
This applications key features include the heart in the center that fluctuates until your chemistry is calculated, the fun unique messages at the bottom, and the compatibility tracker on the right wing of the screen to track who you have previously input and who you are most compatible with.

## Use of Technologies
### Authentication
The user will need an account for this application because this will only track the compatibility with the other person that they input. This means that their name with automatically show up in the text box titled *Your Name Here* after logging in and they can fill in the other name with their own input.
### Database Data
The data that will be stored in the application are the compatibility scores that are tracked in the table on the right. They will be saved and ranked in order. Only the top ten will be visible. These should be visible again when the account is reopened. 
### WebSocket Data
The real-time data that is generated is the compatibility scores. I have not yet decided how to generate these scores yet whether I want to generate an algorithm or just use a random number generator; nonetheless, a score will be generated everytime the calculate button is clicked. However, if the input has previously been used, it should generate the same score as previously, as not to allow the user to try multiple times with the same name to get a different score.
